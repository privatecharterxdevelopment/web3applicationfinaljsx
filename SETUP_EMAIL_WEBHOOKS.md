---

## üîß Required Setup

### Step 1: Configure Database Webhook in Supabase Dashboard

**This CANNOT be done via SQL migration** - Supabase webhooks must be configured in the Dashboard.

#### Instructions:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**
   - Navigate to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your project

2. **Open Database Webhooks**
   - Go to: **Database** ‚Üí **Webhooks**
   - Click **"Enable webhooks"** if not already enabled

3. **Create New Webhook**
   - Click **"Create a new webhook"**

4. **Configure Webhook Settings:**
   ```
   Name: user-request-email-notifications
   Table: user_requests
   Events: ‚úÖ Insert (check this box)
   Type: HTTP Request
   Method: POST
   URL: https://[YOUR-PROJECT-REF].supabase.co/functions/v1/user-request-notifications
   HTTP Headers:
     Authorization: Bearer [YOUR-SERVICE-ROLE-KEY]
     Content-Type: application/json
   ```

5. **Get Your Values:**
   - **Project Ref**: Found in your project URL (e.g., `abcdefghijklmnop`)
   - **Service Role Key**:
     - Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **API**
     - Copy the `service_role` key (NOT the `anon` key)
     - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Keep this secret!**

6. **Save Webhook**
   - Click **"Create webhook"**
   - Status should show as **"Active"**

---

## üìä What This Webhook Does

When a user submits ANY request (jets, helis, taxi, adventures, etc.):

```
1. Request inserted into user_requests table
   ‚Üì
2. Database webhook fires
   ‚Üì
3. Calls Edge Function: user-request-notifications
   ‚Üì
4. Edge Function sends 2 emails via AWS SES:
   - Customer confirmation email
   - Admin notification to bookings@privatecharterx.com
```

---

## ‚úÖ Verification Steps

### Test the Webhook:

1. **Submit a test request** (book any service as a user)

2. **Check Supabase Edge Functions Logs:**
   - Go to **Edge Functions** ‚Üí **user-request-notifications**
   - Click **"Logs"**
   - Should see: `"Processing user request notification for type: [service_type]"`

3. **Check Email Inbox:**
   - **User should receive:** Confirmation email for their request
   - **Admin should receive:** Notification at bookings@privatecharterx.com

4. **Check Database Webhook Logs:**
   - Go back to **Database** ‚Üí **Webhooks**
   - Click on your webhook
   - Check **"Recent webhook calls"**
   - Should see successful calls (HTTP 200)

### Troubleshooting:

**Webhook shows "Failed" status:**
- Check the URL is correct (including your project ref)
- Verify service_role key is correct
- Check Edge Function logs for errors

**Emails not received:**
- Check Edge Function logs for email sending errors
- Verify AWS SES credentials in Edge Function environment variables
- Check spam/junk folders
- Verify email addresses are correct

**Webhook not firing:**
- Ensure "Insert" event is checked
- Verify webhook is "Active" status
- Test by manually inserting a row into user_requests

## üéØ Email Templates Included

The Edge Function already has templates for ALL service types:

‚úÖ Private Jet Charter

‚úÖ Adventures / Fixed Offers
‚úÖ Ground Transport (Taxi/Concierge)
‚úÖ Luxury Car Rental
‚úÖ Event Booking

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret
AWS_REGION=eu-north-1
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@www.privatecharterx.com
ADMIN_EMAIL=bookings@privatecharterx.com

## üîß Alternative: Manual Email Trigger (Not Recommended)

If you cannot configure Dashboard webhooks, you can add manual email sending in the code:

**File:** `src/services/requests.ts` (Line 35)

Change from:
```typescript
await sendEmailNotification(type, data, userEmail);
```

To:
```typescript
// Call Edge Function directly
await supabase.functions.invoke('user-request-notifications', {
  body: { record: request }
});
```

**Issues with this approach:**
- Less reliable than webhooks
- Doesn't retry on failure
- Can be blocked by RLS policies
- Not recommended for production

---

## Summary

**Required:** Configure Database Webhook in Supabase Dashboard (5 minutes)
**Optional:** Verify email sending with test request (2 minutes)
**Result:** Automatic email notifications for ALL service requests ‚úÖ
